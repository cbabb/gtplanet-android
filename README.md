# GTPlanet for Android

This project is a hobby and still very much in beta.

Made with ❤️ in WA using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) on macOS 10.13.6. Tested using Google Pixel (sailfish) running Android 9 "Pie" (min 5.0 "Lollipop").

You can build from source here, or you can check the releases page for prebuilt debug versions.
